## Questions to Answer During Development

1. What's the minimum session duration to count toward streak? (Suggested: 25 min)
2. Should we allow sessions to span multiple days? (Suggested: No for MVP)
3. How far in advance can users plan? (Suggested: 4 weeks)
4. What happens to planned blocks that aren't completed? (Suggested: Mark as missed)
5. Can users edit completed sessions? (Suggested: Yes, but log the edit)

---

## Conclusion

This MVP focuses on the core value proposition: helping users build a deep work habit through planning, tracking, and streaks. The key is simplicity and speed to market. We can iterate based on real user feedback rather than building features that might not be needed.

**Timeline:** 7 days from start to launch  
**Budget:** Free tier services for initial launch  
**Goal:** 100 users in first month, 10% retention after 7 days
